## Hi I'm Dave

I am a physics graduate and a self taught programmer of around 8 years. I am passionate about creating interesting things with programming in my spare time 
and would love to do software development for a career. I can learn any language but I particularly focus my spare time in .NET/C#. 

I also enjoy my free time developing in Unity3D (about 6 years experience) and have spent a large portion of my time learning game development which 
brings many technical challenges providing ample oppotunity to learn and improve. 

My general outlook in life is to learn new things and challenge myself, and I often abide by the phrase taught to me by my Dad "If you are going to do a job, do it properly or don't do it at all".

I am keen to take on things I have not done before that are a challenge, any oppotunity to learn and do new things is something I am keen on.
