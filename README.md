## Hi I'm Dave

I am a physics graduate and a self taught programmer (8 years experience). I am passionate about creating interesting things with programming in my spare time 
and would love to do software development for a career.

I also enjoy developing in Unity3D (6 years experience) and have spent a large portion of my time learning game development techniques which 
brings many technical challenges providing ample oppotunity to learn and improve. 

I am keen to take on things I have not done before that are a challenge, any oppotunity to learn and do new things is a plus!
